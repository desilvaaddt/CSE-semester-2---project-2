~performance analysis of java collection implimentations~

The objective of this program is to test the performance of several Java Collection 
implementations for these methods. 
1. "add" a given element to the collection 
2. check if a collection "contains" a given element 
3. "remove" a given element from the collection (if it is present) 
4. "clear" all the elements in the collection
